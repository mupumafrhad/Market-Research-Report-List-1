<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electro Pneumatic Positioners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Type</li><li>Double Acting Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electro-pneumatic positioners market comprises two main types: single acting and double acting. Single acting positioners utilize pneumatic pressure to move the actuator in one direction, relying on a spring return for the opposite movement. They are often simpler and used in applications where only one direction of movement is needed. In contrast, double acting positioners apply pressure to both directions, providing greater control and precision for complex actuators. This type is ideal for applications requiring both actuating actions, ensuring accurate positioning.</p></p>
